# Ethereum-Based Loan-Borrow Protocol

This is a personal project, following the rules mostly introduced by Aave protocol. It is
aimed to create a simplified version of a lending pool. Currently it WIP and 
its first working version is not finished. 

It provides management of assets, setting an external price oracle, managing users for
various parts of the protocol, blacklisting lenders and borrowers, lending to the protocol
and borrowing from it (collateral-based) etc.

It is a hardhat project with ts tests (not yet completed)
